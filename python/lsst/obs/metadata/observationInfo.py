    Parameters
    ----------

        Representation of an instrument FITS header accessible as a `dict`.
    translator_class : `MetadataTranslator`-class, `optional`

    ------
    ValueError
        The supplied header was not recognized by any of the registered
        translators.

        The supplied translator class was not a MetadataTranslator.
