    Parameters
    ----------
    header : `dict`-like
        Representation of an instrument FITS header accessible as a `dict`.
    translator : `MetadataTranslator`-class, `optional`
        If not `None`, the class to use to translate the supplied headers

    ------
    ValueError
        The supplied header was not recognized by any of the registered
