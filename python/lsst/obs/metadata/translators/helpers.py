"""Generically useful translation helpers which translation classes
can use.

They are written as free functions.  Some of them are written
as if they are methods of `MetadataTranslator`, allowing them to be attached
to translator classes that need them.  These methods have full access to
the translator methods.

Other functions are pure helpers that can be imported and used to help
translation classes without using `MetadataTranslator` properties.
